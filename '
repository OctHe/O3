# Trace Driven Emulation of Rate Adaptation (TDE-RA) Project

This is a simulation platform for the rate adaptation algorithm.
The platform is based on MATLAB for off-line process because MATLAB has lots of useful toolbox to simplify the design.
The platform includes basic signal process blocks in PHY layer, including channel coding, modulation, synchronization, channel estimation.
You can design your own rate adaptation algorithm by deploying the trace-driven evaluation.
The traces can be collected from commercial wireless devices or USRP.

## Supported Standard

1. IEEE 802.11a standard (Legacy mode)

The trace-driven emulation platform for IEEE 802.11a standard is based on the [*comm toolbox*](https://www.mathworks.com/help/comm/).

You can run 

    IEEE80211a_BERvsSNR_threshold.m

to get the BER vs SNR curve and determine the SNR threshold for each modulation and code scheme (MCS).

 
>    Note: The rate adaptation code for IEEE 802.11a standard is not maintained.
 

2. IEEE 802.11ac standard (Very High Throughput mode, VHT)

The trace-driven emulation platform for IEEE 802.11ac standard is based on the [*WLAN toolbox*](https://www.mathworks.com/help/wlan/).

You can run
    
    IEEE80211ac_RA_TDE.m

to display the emulation results of the rate adaptation. 

# Rate adaptation for IEEE 802.11ac standard

The main function of the trace-driven emulation is *IEEE80211ac_RA_TDE*.
It is implemented a SNR-based rate adaptation algorithm and a fixed rate algorithm.

## Options

Some options in *IEEE80211ac_RA_TDE* can be used to display different results.

* __traceFile__ is the file of the collected trace. The format of this file is *.mat* (i.e., the data file of MATLAB). For now, the collect trace is based on the [Atheros CSI tool]().
