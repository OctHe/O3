# sim80211

## Introduction
This is a simulation for the physical layer of OFDM communication system.
The parameter setup, frame structure, and tranceiver pipelines are borrowed from IEEE 802.11 a/g/n/ac standards.
It includes basic signal process blocks, such as modulation/demodulation, time synchronization, channel estimation.

## Configuration of sim80211

Before running the IEEE 802.11n/ac scripts, the configuration is needed by running in the command window of MATLAB
