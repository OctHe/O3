# SimScatter

## Introduction
This is a simulation for the physical layer of OFDM communication system and the OFDM backscatter system
The parameter setup, frame structure, and tranceiver pipelines are borrowed from IEEE 802.11 a/g/n/ac standards.

## Configuration

Before running the IEEE 802.11n/ac scripts, the configuration is needed by running in the command window of MATLAB

    IEEE80211ac_GlobalVariables;

## To Do List

The MATLAB version of SimScatter will not be updated. 
The most important thing of this project is to transfer to Octave.
I want to give an Octave version of this project, since Octave is open source and I do not have MATLAB license anymore.
