# sim80211

This is a simulation platform for the physical layer of IEEE 802.11 standard.
The platform is based on MATLAB for off-line process because MATLAB has lots of useful toolbox to simplify the design.
The platform includes basic signal process blocks, such as channel coding, modulation/demodulation, channel estimation.

## Supported Standard

For now, this project supports IEEE 802.11a standard.

>    Note: The rate adaptation code for IEEE 802.11a standard is not maintained.

You can run 

    IEEE80211a_BERvsSNR_threshold.m

to get the BER vs SNR curve.
