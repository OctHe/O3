# OFDM Baseband Simulation Platform

OFDM Baseband Simulation Platform (OBSP) is a simulation platform that relates to an OFDM-based system.
The simulation platform contains only baseband processes and algorithms of the proposed OFDM system, including follows

- Modulation and demodulation
- Encoding and decoding
- Coarse and fine time synchronization
- Channel estimation

In addition, the frame structure and transmission parameters are referenced to the IEEE 802.11 standard, which is the well-known wireless protocol, but are not guaranteed to be compatible with the standard.

In 2023, the project uses Octave instead of MATLAB, no new features of the MATLAB version will be considered.
The project of Octave version also will contain simulation about OFDM backscatter.

For now, the Octave version is still under-development.
